    About Me
  </h2>
  <p style="text-align: left">
    I am a young, highly motivated and enthusiastic individual looking to gain placement in the
    I.T industry to build on my interest in programming and development.
    I began studying programming 3 years ago and am now in my second year of my degree
    (MEng Computer Science).
    I have knowledge of a few languages and the fundamentals of each and am comfortable in the task
    of building basic software.
    Through my placement, I aim to become a fully qualified Software Developer/Engineer
    and potentially after my masterâ€™s year, branch off into Cyber Security.

<h3>
  Year 1 Java
</h3>
  <p>
    During my first year of university, one of the projects I was tasked with was creating a
    console-based program in the Java language. It was laid out in the form of a UML diagram
    and I wrote the entire program in the Eclipse IDE. Following the lecture notes and seeking
    outside assistance in the form of the internet or friends, I was able to successfully complete
    the entire first section of the UML. Unfortunately, due to time restraints and other
    complications, I was not able to finish the entirety of the UML and had to settle
    for just a pass on this particular project.
  </p>
<h3>
  Year 2 Database
</h3>
  <p>
    During my second year of university, I was assigned a group project based around SQL
    databases. In this project I was assigned into a random team of 6 people and together,
    we had to work toward the creation of a database relating to housing and Office space
    for QUB staff and students. We split the work up in a way that we deemed fair, I was
    given the task of creating the database itself, aswell as queries used for the
    insertion of data and deleting the table when neccessary. My work in this project, combined
    with an exam which was sat in January got me a first overall in this particular module.

      District
    </h3>
  <p>
    This is the main project of my second year of University. In it, I am tasked with
    working within a group of 5 other individuals and together we must design and create
    a working project within Android Studio and using Java. Throughout the project we
    have been following an agile methodology for when it comes to our hand-ins and
    our personal work-load. It has been split across 9 Sprints throughout the year
    and it is due for hand-in in late March.
